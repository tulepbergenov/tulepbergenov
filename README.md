ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is

# Daulet Tulepbergenov

I am a frontend developer with a focus on semantics and website accessibility.
I'm convinced that everyone should have equal access to information on the web,
so I try to create websites that are as user-friendly as possible for everyone.

I also love playing guitar and bass guitar, especially metal music.
Sometimes I like to relax with a beer, especially after a long day at the computer.

My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, and I work at it every day.

Recently I started to get interested in the topic of web3 and have already started to explore this direction.

I will be happy to share my work in this area with you in the future on this page:D
